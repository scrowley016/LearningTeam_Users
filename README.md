# Learning Team Warmup Users Database



## Step 1: Initialize the database

Run this command from your terminal:

```bash
psql -f warmup_data.sql
```

This will create a database called `warmup_db` and fill it with some sample user data.

## Step 2: Connect to the database


Launch the Postgres terminal:

```bash
psql
```

Then, connect to the database:

```sql
\c warmup_db
```

Run `\d` to list all of the tables in the connected database. You should see a single table named `users`.

Run `\d users` to get more details about the `users` table.

Youâ€™re now ready to query the database!
